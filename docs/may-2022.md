## Enhancements

### Ability to remove servers from the list of connected PMM instances
Users with PMM Admin rights can now remove entries from the list of servers connected to Percona Platform. This is useful for getting rid of lingering servers that have lost internet connection, or that have been retired for numerous reasons.

To remove a disconnected server and keep an accurate list of your PMM servers, go to the **PMM Instances** tab on the main menu, and click the ![Remove icon](images/remove-instance.png) next to the server you want to remove from the list.

### Refined registration flow when using a social identity provider
Registering a new Percona Platform account with a Google or GitHub account now requires you to read and accept the Terms of Service and the Privacy Policy for Percona Platform. 
We know it’s not the most exciting reading, but we encourage you to check these to better understand how you can use our services, and how we protect the information you put in our control.

In addition, we’ve changed the label of the social Log in buttons from **Sign in with Google/Sign in with GitHub** to **Continue with Google/Continue with GitHub**. This is to emphasize that you can also use this option to create a new Percona Platform account in case your Google/Github account is not associated with an account yet.

## Fixed issues
- Removed vertical scroll bar that appeared on the Log in page after entering an email address in the **Sign in to Percona Platform** box. 
- The Percona Platform Terms of Service note no longer dissapears after entering credentials on the Registration and Log in page.
