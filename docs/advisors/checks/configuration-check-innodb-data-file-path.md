# MySQL InnoDB table space has a max cap and cannot auto-extend

## Description
Some InnoDB Tablespaces specify a maximum size limit, which means that the file size can not exceed that limit. 

Reaching this limit could cause production problems. 

For more information, see [The System Tablespace in the MySQL documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-system-tablespace.html).

## Rule
`SELECT * from performance_schema.global_variables where VARIABLE_NAME in ('innodb_data_file_path');`


## Resolution
In most cases, we do not recommend having any maximum size limit on InnoDB Tablespaces.
