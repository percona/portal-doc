# [Human-friendly title]
Titles should be specific, self-explanatory, and precise.
A title must be a summary and exact indicator of what the check does, a short summary of the problem we are reporting to the user about their environment: 

- Don’t use abstract titles 
- 
Mongo DB Authentication
MongoDB authentication is disabled
- Including the word check in the title is redundant:
MySQL user check
Incorrect MySQL users setup

MySQL Binary Logs check, Local infile and local infile
Non-optimal settings for MySQL binary logs, local infile and SQL mode.


## Description
The description should answer the questions of **what is this**, and **why should I care about this**.
Start with a brief definition, if the concept is unfamiliar. Make sure the shortdesc contains the main point of the check.


DO:
- Provide useful context about the problem that this check solves.
- Answer the questions of what are the benefits of the check, and what is the purpose of the check
- Include information about when the user should consider running this (or why the check is necessary).
- Try as much as possible to rewrite sentences, so that they don’t exceed 13-15 words. 


**DON'T**
- Restate the title.
- State the obvious.
- Start the shortdesc with this check 
- Use the shortdesc as a lead-in sentence
