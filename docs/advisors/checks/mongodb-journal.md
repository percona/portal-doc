# MongoDB journal enabled

## Description
This check warns if the journal is not enabled. 
This is dangerous because you could have a serious issue for data durability in case of a failure.


For Production systems, enable journal to ensure that data files are valid/recoverable.

It is always recommended to enable the journal. 

More recent versions of MongoDB donâ€™t allow turning off the journal. 
MongoDB enables journaling by default in recent versions (4.0 +).

For more information, see the [Journaling section in the MongoDB documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/journaling/).
