Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) includes a set of Advisors that run checks against the databases connected to PMM. The checks identify and alert you of potential security threats, performance degradation, data loss, data corruption, non-compliance issues, etc.

## Prerequisites for accessing Advisor checks

All checks are hosted on Percona Platform. PMM Server automatically downloads them from here when the **Advisors** and **Telemetry** options are enabled in PMM under **Configuration > Settings > Advanced Settings**. Both options are enabled by default.

## Advisor check tiers and entitlements

Depending on the entitlements available for your Percona Account, the set of advisor checks that PMM can download from Percona Platform differ in terms of complexity and functionality.

If your PMM instance is not connected to Percona Platform, PMM can only download the basic set of Anonymous advisor checks.
As soon as you connect your PMM instance to Percona Platform, has access to additional checks, available only for Registered PMM instances.

If you are a Percona customer with a Percona Customer Portal account, you also get access to Paid checks, which offer more advanced database health information.

## Checks results

The checks can be executed manually or automatically. Manual checks can be executed individually, or all together. 

Automatic checks run every 24 hours by default. You can configure this interval in **PMM > Advanced Settings > Execution intervals** by changing the label interval for each check, or by changing the default intervals to custom ones:

-  **Standard**- 24 hours
-  **Rare** - 78 hours
-  **Frequent** - 4 hours

The results are sent to PMM Server where you can review any failed checks on the **Home Dashboard > Failed Advisor Checks** panel. The summary count of failed checks is classified as <b style="color:#e02f44;">Critical</b>, <b style="color:#e36526;">Major</b> and <b style="color:#5794f2;">Trivial</b>:

Check results data always remains on the PMM Server and are not related to anonymous data sent for Telemetry purposes.

For information on configuring PMM Advisors, see the [Percona Monitoring and Management documentation](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/2.x/how-to/advisors.html).
