## Complete infrastructure for test-driving Percona DBaaS 

Weâ€™ve renamed and upgraded the previous **Free Kubernetes** feature to **Percona DBaaS**. This new option generates fully configured clusters, automatically provisioned with a PMM server, for which the DBaaS feature is already enabled.

These read-to-go environments enable you to spend the three available test hours monitoring your DB cluster and evaluating all the benefits of PMM DBaaS. No Kubeconfig files to register, no PMM server to provision, no fuss, no mess.
