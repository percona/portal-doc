## Test-drive PMM from within Percona Platform

We’ve replaced the previous **Free Kubernetes** feature with an option to generate a full-fledged PMM environment from Percona Platform.

The new **Try Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM)** option creates fully configured K8 clusters, automatically provisioned with a PMM server.

These ready-to-go environment enable you to spend the three available test hours monitoring your temporary DB cluster and evaluating all the features that PMM has to offer. No kubeconfig files to register, no PMM server to provision, no fuss, no mess. 

For more information, see [Launch PMM environment](../launch_PMM.md).
