# Gain insight into your organization with Activity Logging

Activity Logging provides visibility into who has access to Percona Platform and what changes they're doing to the resources they have access to. 

This increases security and helps organizations safely adopt Percona Platform, while enforcing governance and maintaining compliance. 

The new **Activity Log** option on the **Organization** tab helps Administrators gather data about important activity across their organization for compliance, auditing, and monitoring purposes.

Currently, the following activity is being recorded:

- changes to organization details
- changes to organization members
- connected/disconnected PMM instances
- user activity

Activity log events are available for the last year. Future updates will enable you to check older logs and expose additional data.
