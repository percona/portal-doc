# Working with the Dashboard

The Dashboard is where you first land when logging into your Percona Platform account, and provides you with a high-level overview of everything you need to know. Here you will find:

- the list of entitlements associated to your organization and general information about your account
- links to resources and contact points for accessing help

If you are a Percona customer, you get further access to: 
- list of Customer Support tickets open across your organization
- Tickets Overview Widget summarizing your interaction with Percona Customer Support
- contact Customer Support to open new tickets
