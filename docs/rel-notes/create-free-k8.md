# Launch free Kubernetes clusters
Launch a free Kubernetes cluster with three worker nodes, 4 CPUs and 8 GB of RAM straight from Percona Platform. You can create one free cluster per day. Free clusters expire in three hours. This makes them ideal for testing out PMM with DBaaS and Percona Operators in a native Kubernetes experience. 

To launch a free cluster:

1. In the **Free Kubernetes** tab, select **Launch a new cluster**. Percona Platform starts provisioning the cluster, which can take a few minutes.  
2. Once the cluster is created, click **Show kubeconfig**.
3. Click **Copy to clipboard** in the **Kubernetes Cluster Configuration**.
4. Go to your PMM instance and [Add your new Kubernetes cluster](https://docs.percona.com/percona-monitoring-and-management/using/dbaas.html#kubernetes-clusters).
