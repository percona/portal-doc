## Enhancements

### New PMM security checks available via Percona Platform
Percona Platform now hosts a variety of new checks for MySQL, MongoDB and PostgreSQL databases connected to PMM. See the list of new checks and their availability to **registered** and **anonymous** PMM instances in the [Security checks for PMM](checks.md) topic. 

### Open Support tickets straight from Percona Platform
If you are a Percona customer, you can now use the new **Open new ticket** option on the **Dashboard** page to reach Customer Support easier. 

If you have an active [Customer Portal](https://percona.service-now.com/) session running in the same browser, you can submit a new support request immediately. Otherwise, you will first be asked to log in with your Percona Account to start a new session.

### More context information when deleting organization members
The **Delete Organization Member** dialog box now also shows the email of the user you are removing from your organization. 

This helps administrators ensure that they don't accidentally remove wrong users from their organization.
