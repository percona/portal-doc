## "Create Organization" provileges extended to all Customer Portal users
Creating a customer organization is no longer limited to users with **Admin** rights in Customer Portal. Percona Platform will now create the organization for any member of a Customer Portal organization who first logs into Percona Platform.

The user who creates the organization will be automatically assigned the **Admin** role in Percona Platform. Other organization members subsequently logging in to Percona Platform will be automatically added as members of the existing organization, and assigned the same roles that they currently have in Customer Portal.



## Dashboard tab displays your current user role
You can now check your current user within the organization in the **Dashboard** tab > **Your account**. 


## Notification emails for suspended accounts
Organization members whose accounts have been suspended in the Customer Portal are now notified by email that their accounts have been suspended and can no longer sign into Percona Platform.
