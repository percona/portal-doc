## Enhancements

### Tickets Overview Widget
 The Dashboard now includes a widget that shows at-a-glance overview of the support tickets open across your organization. This enables you to quickly assess your level of interaction with Percona Customer Support, and to identify the areas where you most requested assistance from Percona. 
 
### Bulk invite team members to your organization
We’re simplifying the onboarding of your team to Percona Portal with bulk invites for joining  organizations. 

You can now invite multiple users at a time, while ensuring that your teammates are added to the right role when they accept the invite. 

Go to **Organization > Members > Invite Members** where you can enter one or multiple email addresses for an invitee. You’ll notice there’s now an **Add another user** option which enables you to send out up to ten invitations at a time.

## Fixed issues
- Accessing the URLs for certain Percona Platform subpages without being authenticated would show a blank screen instead of redirecting to the Log in page. This issue is now fixed.

- Improved the error message displayed when logging in as a Technical user to access an organization that is not active yet.
