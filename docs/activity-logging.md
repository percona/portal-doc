# Check activity logs

Activity logging provides a simple, powerful interface for collecting all traceable activities within an organization.

Organization Administrators can track changes made by users in the organization, over the past year to identify:

- changes to organization details
- changes to organization members
- connected/disconnected PMM instances
- user activity

To check the activity logs for your organization:

1. Make sure you are logged in as an Administrator.
2. Go to the **Organization** tab > **Activity Log**.
3. From the drop-down menu, select the time period for which you want to check the activity logs.
4. Click on the column headers in the table  to filter logs based on the selected criteria.
