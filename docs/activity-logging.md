# Activity Logging

Activity logs provide a simple, powerful interface for organization Administrators to collect all traceable activities within their organization. 


This enables them to view changes made by users in your organization, over the past year.


The logs show the following events in the organization, and who initiated them:
- changes to organization details
- changes to organization members
- connected/disconnected PMM instances
- user activity

To check the activity logs for your organization:
1. Make sure you are logged in as an Administrator.
2. Go to the **Organization** tab > **Activity Log**. 
3. From the drop-down menu, select the time period for which you want to check the activity logs. 
4. Click on the column headers in the table  to filter logs based on the selected criteria.
