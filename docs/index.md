Percona Platform is a unified experience to monitor, manage, secure, and optimize database environments. 

Percona Platform brings together distributions of MySQL, PostgreSQL and MongoDB, and includes a range of open-source tools for data backup, availability and management. 
It also includes Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) for database management, monitoring, and automated insights, making it easier to manage database deployments.

## Start here

Here's how to get started with Percona Platform:

1. [Create a Percona Account](registration-login.md).

2. [Connect your Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) server](connect-pmm.md). 

    PMM is a free, open-source monitoring tool for MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, ProxySQL, and the servers they run on. 

    Connect your PMM server to Percona Platform to access your PMM monitoring tools and data from here and make Percona Platform your one command center for all the Percona software and services available for your account.

3. [Create an organization](create-manage-organizations.md) to start collaborating with members of your team and share access to your Percona software and services.
